# Hi

This is the "Librarian" demo. Here I have a stepper with dynamic view.
From the first and second step we can choose genres and subgenres and the interesting
part is that when we are ate second step (choosing subgenre) we can choose to add another
genre. Then we update the stepper to have one more section where contains the "Add new subgenre"
view. After we filled the subgenre name we can go to the "Info" step where we can add the 
info about the book. And when we are ready we are moving to the "Success" page.
